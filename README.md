# React Markdown Previewer

A Free Code Camp assignment.

## Objective

Build a Markdown Previewer

Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/JXrLLE/).

**User Story**: I can type GitHub-flavored Markdown into a text area.

**User Story**: I can see a preview of the output of my markdown that is updated as I type.


## Completed App

## Notable learning/features

The HTML formatted markup updates instantly without a full page refresh upon changing the text. 

I used an NPM module called Marked. This can be utilised via CDN and link tag in the html or installed via NPM. I used the CDN version here.

Used React for the first time.

Props and State

app.js stores the state for the whole app

Use of React's onChange and creating a handleChange function to update the state.

Passing a reference to handleChange down to a child component so that it can update the state

Another child component gets the updated state handed back down to it via props.

Stateless Functional Components can have a shorter syntax style.

Change to use webpack-dev-server
make index.html stored in in app dir, not the src dir. The html file should be dynamically generated on running webpack.

Use webpack-dev-server... creating webpack files every time is too slow
