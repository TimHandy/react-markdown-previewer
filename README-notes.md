# TODOs 

uninstall the markdown npm module... I added it via CDN

Add comments throughout

Change let to const wherever possible

CSS needs a lot of work

Use some Sass, not just standard css

containers should expand vertically as text expands... min-height?

Styling? Responsive?

Add some text about the project below

Create as a github pages site.

Add to portfolio

Change app to src?

Change to use webpack-dev-server
make index.html stored in in app dir, not the src dir. The html file should be dynamically generated on running webpack.

Next time... use webpack-dev-server... creating webpack files every time is too slow

Add some Mocha testing
